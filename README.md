# Clump mass

Image analysis software that does source detection and measurement of properties in images from the Hubble Space Telescope.

Configure specific settings in file clump_mass.py and run that script. 

The second file, clump_mass_to_light.py, will be imported by the main script, so place that in the same directory.
